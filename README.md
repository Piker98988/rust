This is my repository for the rust by practice [book](https://practice.rs). This [book](https://practice.rs) contains a plethora of exercises to complete with the purpose of achieving rust mastery.

## Declarations

I'll do my best, learning rust will be serious this time, so this repo will be updated pretty much daily with the exercises from the [book](https://practice.rs) I complete every time.

I may not make the best practices with git, because i'll just commit whatever i have done for the day.

## When completed

Once I complete the book, I will try to make my own programming language even though I have fallen in love with rust. I will to hone my skills even more so rust becomes my main programming language.

Also, I will start doing some [leetcode](https://leetcode.com) problems to learn algorithms and that type of thing.
